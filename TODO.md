### backlogs
- ✅ make sure observation shape aligns with observation space
  - ✅ run assert if the **observation** aligns with the **observation space**

### now
- let's do a little sidequest and make the game playable for the frontend
- merge `refactor-backend` once we get to see the API successfully return game states
- deprio anything related with acquiring agents' `_get_observation()`

---
### others
- ✅ materialize game state and initial state
- generate ANSI representation of game state
  - ansi will output on backend terminal
  - while all training and triggering will be done on ministry frontend

### very, very, veryyyyyy far along the way
  - visualize NN activations, inputs, and outputs [frontend]
